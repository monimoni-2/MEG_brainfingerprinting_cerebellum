# MEG_brainfingerprinting_cerebellum
Code used for the COGS 396 research project (Summer 2023). Our objectives are (1) brain-fingerprint FA patients and HCs using cerebellar spectral features, (2) identify salient features that differentiate FA patients and HCs. 
All codes will be organized and updated soon.
